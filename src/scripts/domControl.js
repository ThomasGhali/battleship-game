/*
    --- start game page ---

- once the player's name is chosen, 
  make a gameflow instance with the player's name.

    --- place ships page ---

- make a function for placing, where:
  -  when the user holds a ship and then hovers over a div, it 
  should run a function that sees if this move is valid; 
  if the move is invalid then add ".invalid" class.
  - this function should recieve the coords, length and direction
  for the ship 

- when the player is placing ships, each div hovering should run
  the checkCoords function.
